* Fundamentals of Data Analysis: Project 2020
* Sep 2020

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Project Instructions:**

In this project you must perform and explain simple linear regression using Python on the powerproduction dataset provided (provided in the git repository). The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.

1. Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.
2. In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
To enhance your submission, you might consider comparing simple linear regression to other types of regression on this data set. 


**How to run the file:**
1.  Open Task 2020.ipynb in Jupyterlab or Jupyter notebook .
2. click the Kernel button and select Restart & Run All. 
3. when the pop window appear select Restart and Run All Cells.
